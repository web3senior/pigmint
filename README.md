# 🐷 Pigmint — Your Mood, On-Chain

Pigmint is a lightweight, mood-of-the-day mini-app built on the LUKSO blockchain. It lets users express how they feel whether it's Happy, Sad, Angry, Love, etc. by updating a dynamic NFT that reflects their current vibe through a pig-face avatar. It’s simple, social and expressive.

✨ Core Features
Dynamic Mood NFT: Each user mints a pig-face NFT (FREE to claim, 1 per Universal Profile)
When they change their mood, the NFT updates on-chain using LUKSO’s LSPs (Upgradeable Metadata), ensuring the current expression and associated image are always up-to-date across the ecosystem.

Piggy Expressions: The pig avatar transforms based on your mood — visually fun, emotionally expressive.

Short Bio Status: Users can also add a mini status to share what they're feeling, doing or currently working on.

One per UP: If you transfer your Pig, you lose the ability to update it — keeping expression tied to identity to the owner of the Pig.

🚀 Why Pigmint?
The digital world often lacks ambient, emotional context. Pigmint solves this by letting people show up on-chain in a more human way — their mood becomes part of their digital identity.

How can this mini-app improve the social experience in web3? 
Spark ambient social interactions — moods and statuses invite comments, empathy or connection.

Encourage routine check-ins — small updates like mood changes create habits and drive regular visits back to The Grid.

Bring more life to Universal Profiles — beyond static NFTs, these dynamic avatars bring personality, movement and emotion to identity.
